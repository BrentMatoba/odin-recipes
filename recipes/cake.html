    <h1>Japanese Christmas Cake</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Think Christmas cake and no doubt a rich fruitcake will spring to mind. Should you fancy something a little lighter—but as much of a showstopper as the traditional holiday confection—try a Kurisumasu Keki, or Japanese Christmas cake. The only fruit you'll find is strawberries, plus a heaping of whipped cream wrapped between and all over a light-as-air sponge cake.</p>
        <p>The cake is easy to make and to decorate as elaborately or as simply as you wish. Whichever you choose, however, the cake must always have a Santa Claus somewhere—otherwise, this would not be a traditional Christmas cake!</p>
