# odin-recipes
Before: Starting my first project with the ODIN Project curriculum! The
goal is to practice making webpages, and using different elements like
anchor, paragraph, and images. These elements will be combined into a rudimentary recipe website.

After: Done! That wasn't too hard, I only had to look at my notes once or twice. I got really familiar with the all the tags I used and had a lot of fun making my first website. To many more!
